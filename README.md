# Pose Detection Using MediaPipe & OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time **human pose detection** using **MediaPipe Pose** and **OpenCV**. The script detects body landmarks from a video, draws pose connections, and shows FPS along with keypoints on the frame.

## 🚀 Features
- Detects **33 pose landmarks**
- Draws **pose skeleton**
- Marks each keypoint with a circle
- Displays **FPS**
- Works with a video file or webcam
